# Knowledge extraction - Openreview

The assignment is to develop code that combines LLMs and traditional ML to extract knowledge from the [Openreview](https://github.com/Seafoodair/Openreview) review dataset.\
The goal is to find interesting patterns in reviews (and possibly also in papers) that can give hints to authors about how to write better papers.\
The expected output is a ipynb file with the analysis. All the code provided can be run directly on the notebook file.

### Small note
The code has been developed and tested in colab environment using as runtime type `T4 GPU` in order to have more computational power and disk space (which was limited in my local environment). For this reason performances might be different if you try to run it locally.

### Invalid notebook
Github for some reason doesn't allow to visualize the notebook via web browser giving an error "Invalid notebook". 
As the notebook has been exported directly from colab, it is better to actually download the file and run it locally or upload it in colab.

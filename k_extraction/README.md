# Knowledge extraction - Openreview

The assignment is to develop code that combines LLMs and traditional ML to extract knowledge from the [Openreview](https://github.com/Seafoodair/Openreview) review dataset.\
The goal is to find interesting patterns in reviews (and possibly also in papers) that can give hints to authors about how to write better papers.\
The expected output is a ipynb file with the analysis. All the code provided can be run directly on the notebook file.

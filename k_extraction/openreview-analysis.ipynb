We find clear evidence of six emergent phases in agent strategy in our environment, each of which creates a new pressure for the opposing team to adapt; for instance, agents learn to build multi-object shelters using moveable boxes which in turn leads to agents discovering that they can overcome obstacles using ramps. We further provide evidence that multi-agent competition may scale better with increasing environment complexity and leads to behavior that centers around far more human-relevant skills than other self-supervised reinforcement learning methods such as intrinsic motivation. Finally, we propose transfer and fine-tuning as a way to quantitatively evaluate targeted capabilities, and we compare hide-and-seek agents to both intrinsic motivation and random initialization baselines in a suite of domain-specific intelligence tests.\",\n          \"Abstract:###Sample-selection approaches, which attempt to pick up clean instances from the training data set, have become one promising direction to robust learning from corrupted labels. These methods all build on the memorization effect, which means deep networks learn easy patterns first and then gradually over-fit the training data set. In this paper, we show how to properly select instances so that the training process can benefit the most from the memorization effect is a hard problem. Specifically, memorization can heavily depend on many factors, e.g., data set and network architecture. Nonetheless, there still exists general patterns of how memorization can occur. These facts motivate us to exploit memorization by automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques. First, we designed an expressive but compact search space based on observed general patterns. Then, we propose to use the natural gradient-based search algorithm to efficiently search through space. Finally, extensive experiments on both synthetic data sets and benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can not only be much efficient than existing AutoML algorithms but can also achieve much better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches for learning from corrupted labels.\",\n          \"Abstract:###The dynamics of DNNs during gradient descent is described by the so-called Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).

Testing is conducting from the viewpoint of balancing accuracy with various resource metrics such as number of parameters, memory footprint, etc. In the end, reviewer scores were partitioned as two accepts and two rejects. However, the actual comments indicate that both nominal accept reviewers expressed borderline opinions regarding this work (e.g., one preferred a score of 4 or 5 if available, while the other explicitly stated that the paper was borderline acceptance-worthy). Consequently in aggregate there was no strong support for acceptance and non-dismissable sentiment towards rejection. For example, consistent with reviewer comments, a primary concern with this paper is that the novelty and technical contribution is rather limited, and hence, to warrant acceptance the empirical component should be especially compelling. However, all the experiments are limited to cifar10/cifar100 data, with the exception of a couple extra tests on tiny ImageNet added after the rebuttal. But these latter experiments are not so convincing since the base architecture has the best accuracy on VGG, and only on a single MobileNet test do we actually see clear-cut improvement. Moreover, these new results appear to be based on just a single trial per data set (this important detail is unclear), and judging from Figure 2 of the revision, MobileNet results on cifar data can have very high variance blurring the distinction between methods. It is therefore hard to draw firm conclusions at this point, and these two additional tiny ImageNet tests notwithstanding, we don*t really know how to differentiate phenomena that are intrinsic to cifar data from other potentially relevant factors. Overall then, my view is that far more testing with different data types is warranted to strengthen the conclusions of this paper and compensate for the modest technical contribution. Note also that training with all of these different filter templates is likely no less computationally expensive than some state-of-the-art pruning or related compression methods, and therefore it would be worth comparing head-to-head with such approaches. This is especially true given that in many scenarios, test-time computational resources are more critical than marginal differences in training time, etc.\",\n          \"Comment:###Main content: Blind review #3 summarizes it well: This paper presents a technique for encoding the high level \\u201cstyle\\u201d of pieces of symbolic music. The music is represented as a variant of the MIDI format. The main strategy is to condition a Music Transformer architecture on this global \\u201cstyle embedding\\u201d. Additionally, the Music Transformer model is also conditioned on a combination of both \\u201cstyle\\u201d and \\u201cmelody\\u201d embeddings to try and generate music \\u201csimilar\\u201d to the conditioning melody but in the style of the performance embedding. -- Discussion: The reviewers questioned the novelty. Blind review #2 wrote: *Overall, I think the paper presents an interesting application and parts of it are well written, however I have concerns with the technical presentation in parts of the paper and some of the methodology. Firstly, I think the algorithmic novelty in the paper is fairly limited. The performance conditioning vector is generated by an additional encoding transformer, compared to the Music Transformer paper (Huang et. al. 2019b). However, the limited algorithmic novelty is not the main concern. The authors also mention an internal dataset of music audio and transcriptions, which can be a major contribution to the music information retrieval (MIR) community. However it is not clear if this dataset will be publicly released or is only for internal experiments.* However, after revision, the same reviewer has upgraded the review to a weak accept, as the authors wrote *We emphasize that our goal is to provide users with more fine-grained control over the outputs generated by a seq2seq language model. Despite its simplicity, our method is able to learn a global representation of style for a Transformer, which to the best of our knowledge is a novel contribution for music generation. Additionally, we can synthesize an arbitrary melody into the style of another performance, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our results both quantitatively (metrics) and qualitatively (interpolations, samples, and user listening studies).* -- Recommendation and justification: This paper is borderline for the reasons above, and due to the large number of strong papers, is not accepted at this time. As one comment, this work might actually be more suitable for a more specialized conference like ISMIR, as its novel contribution is more to music applications than to fundamental machine learning approaches.\",\n          \"Comment:###This work extends the previously introduced NMN for VQA for handling reasoning over text using symbolic reasoning components that can perform counting, sorting etc and can be compositionally combined.

The paper improves on top of the stochastic three points method (STP), an existing work (published in arXiv), by proposing adding momentum (SMTP). The intuition behind both STP and SMTP is rather straighforward: you sample a random direction s, then given your current position x you check x+as and x-as. You then move to the best position from (x, x+as, x_as). In a way, this is like computing the numerical derivatives (instead of the gradient) given a random location and its mirror, and then applying gradient descent given the best numerical derivative. However, take this analogy with a large grain of salt, as there are many differences with GD. The proposed algorithm adds momentum and importance sampling. Momentum helps speed up convergence, as the paper shows for non-convex, convex and strongly convex functions. All three cases are individually examined and bounds are derived regarding the speed of convergence. For the non-convex case the speed of convergence is 1/sqrt{K}, K being the number of iterations. For the convex case it is 1/K. For the strongly convex case the (unrealistic) assumption of knowing the optimal value is removed while maintaining the same speed of convergence. Importance sampling helps computing the derivatives focusing on those coordinate dimensions that are more critical to the objective function f(x), improving the speed of convergence further. The importance sampling is proportional to the coordinate-wise Lipschitz constants, assuming that the objective function is coordinate-wise Lipschitz smooth. The methods are validated on five different cases of MuJoCo. Results seem good when compared to the STP ones. Compared to policy gradient methods, the results seem much better. Strengths: + The paper presents a small but interesting and well-motivated addition to the original algorithm STP. I particularly liked how straightforward the final algorithm is: applying momentum and sampling according to the Lipschitz constants. + At least at a first glance the results look good. Compared to STP in figure 1 there is a clear improvement not only in the final optimum but also in the speed of attaining the said optimum. + I liked a lot the presentation and clarity of writing. While quite mathematically dense, it was easy to follow the big story and understand that underlying points. Weaknesses: + While interesting and useful, I am not completely convinced whether the added novelty over (Bergou et al, 2019) is significant enough. At the end of the day, the final algorithm is the conglomeration of two existing algorithms, that is STP and momentum. STP is very similar to the final algorithm, after all it is the basis for it. The authors argue that it is not trivial to select the next points under the momentum term. To this end, they propose to rely on yet another existing approach, that is the virtual iterates analysis from (Yang et al. 2016). However, it is not clear why these points are *optimal*, what is so *non-trivial* about selecting them? This is basically skimmed over in two lines. + In the strongly convex case one assumption (knowing the f(x*) ) is replaced with another assumption, that all points lie on a hypersphere (|s|_2=1). I suppose this would assume a spherical normalization of the input space. While this is not an unrealistic assumption, it does place a constraint which could be problematic in the case of high dimensions for s? In that case the high dimensionality would render distances rather unreliable and in turn could hurt convergence? This is also perhaps the reason that only the MuJoCo enviroments were tested? In general, I would say that the strongly convex case was discussed less clearly and it is not exactly clear the final result. In the end, eq (25) does contain f(x*), whereas in the convex case K does not (K approx 2 R_0^2 L ?_D/(??_D^2). + Some statements are unclear. ++ In p. 2 some symbols are not explained, e.g., ?. While it is quite clear for peopled versed in the field, in my opinion it is bad practice to leave notation not explained. ++ In assumption 3.1 seems rather trivial? Wouldn*t ?_D by definition be always positive, since is the expectation of a squared norm (always positive)? Does this need to be an assumption? ++ Between eq. (11) and (12) there is reference to (35)? What is (35)? ++ It is not clear in practice how the importance sampling is performed. In Algorithm 2 the probabilities p_i are defined as function inputs and then never updated. Is that true? If yes, how is p_i decided in the first place? What is the connection to the Lipschitz constants L_i? + A highly relevant field appears to be Bayesian Optimization, where also one cannot compute gradients and must optimize a black-box function. Some relevant recent works are [1] and [2] for continuous and discrete inputs. It would be interesting to discuss what are the distinct differences with bayesian optimization methods in [1] and [2]. + I would say that the paper is rather on the light side regarding experiments. Only MuJoCo is used as an experimental setup. It would be nice to also report results on synthetic experiments with known functions to better understand the limitations of the algorithm. Synthetic and realistic setups can be found in [1] and [2]. What is more, the experimental choices are not entirely clear. What is the *predefined reward threshold* and why was that chosen? For instance, the leaderboard for *Swimmer* is in: https://www.endtoend.ai/envs/gym/mujoco/swimmer/. How does the proposed algorithm fair compared to these works? Also, *maybe* it would be interesting to compare even against [1] or [2] (I guess [2] is harder as it is for discete inputs), assuming that a relatively low number of iterations is performed.

Poloczek, ICML 2018\",\n          \" Summary: This paper describes a contextual encoding scheme for reconstruction of 3D pointclouds from 2D images. An encoder outputs the parameters of a hierarchy of reconstruction networks that can be applied in succession to map random samples on a unit sphere to the surface of the reconstructed shape. Strengths: The author*s model was quite novel in my opinion. Deep 2D->3D is becoming a crowded space and there are many other models that encode image inputs, and many others that perform recursive or composition-based decoding. However, the particular link here was interesting, and I appreciate the small number of parameters resulting in solid reconstruction performance. While most related work was covered well, I believe the authors could have a more up-to-date list of recent work that reconstructs triangle-mesh representations from images [A-C] (especially since several of these methods has an architecture that involves encoding and subsequent compositional refinement). Some of the reconstructions shown in this paper are quite impressive, and the quantitative results show outperforming 2 recent methods. I did appreciate also the novel path-based evaluation of shape accuracy in the Appendix, although it would have been helpful to see more discussion of this in the main paper. Areas for improvement: I found that the core technical description was quite brief and would have benefited from simply more detail and space. You have argued that your method is sensible to try (cog. sci motivations), and shown that one instance works, but what can we expect in a more mathematical or general sense? Can any sizes of encoder and mapping network fit together? How does the number of mapping layers effect performance? Won*t we eventually expect vanishing/exploding gradients with particular activation and can one address this in some way? I note that recent papers in this field tend to perform significantly more extensive experimental evaluation, typically selecting a wider range of competitors and using a number of more standardized metrics including IOU, F1 score and CD and typically repeating these at a variety of resolutions or on additional datasets or category splits etc. Decision: Weak reject because the idea is quite interesting, but I believe a more thorough explanation and expanded experimental comparison would be of great help to ensure the community can appreciate this work.

The main contribution includes using the Gumbel-softmax trick to relax categorical distributions and use back-propagation to estimate the gradient jointly with the tas neural network. The proposed solution has the flexibility of able to be used in several different tasks, such as inverse problems ( super-resolution or image completion) or classification tasks. The paper is very well written. The paper locates itself well in current baselines and explains Experiments mostly well. However, there are significant limitations in demonstrating the effectiveness/impact of the proposed technique: 1) The only comparison to another non-fixed sampling baseline is Kool et al. 2019. The visualization and a thorough comparison were missing in MNIST classification. This baseline was also missing in image reconstruction. 2) Compressive Sensing incorporates vast literature of algorithms focusing on different aspects of improvements; algorithms focused on classification and inverse problems. Even if done disjointly, how does the proposed joint learning is compared to those algorithms in these domains? 3) Top row of Figure 3 nicely explains how the learned sampling paradigm performs compared to other mechanisms (such as uniform, random, low-pass). But there is no comparision against other non-fixed techniques.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_contentlength\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1611,\n        \"min\": 107,\n        \"max\": 24287,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3773,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1057,\n          125,\n          4525\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

            "Abstract:###Temporal difference (TD) learning is a popular algorithm for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, but the vanilla TD can substantially suffer from the inherent optimization variance. A variance reduced TD (VRTD) algorithm was proposed by Korda and La (2015), which applies the variance reduction technique directly to the online TD learning with Markovian samples. In this work, we first point out the technical errors in the analysis of VRTD in Korda and La (2015), and then provide a mathematically solid analysis of the non-asymptotic convergence of VRTD and its variance reduction performance. We show that VRTD is guaranteed to converge to a neighborhood of the fixed-point solution of TD at a linear convergence rate. Furthermore, the variance error (for both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling) and the bias error (for Markovian sampling) of VRTD are significantly reduced by the batch size of variance reduction in comparison to those of vanilla TD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         5\n",
            "Abstract:###Due to its extensive use in databases, the relational model is ubiquitous in representing big-data. However, recent progress in deep learning with relational data has been focused on (knowledge) graphs. In this paper we propose Equivariant Entity-Relationship Networks, the class of parameter-sharing neural networks derived from the entity-relationship model. We prove that our proposed feed-forward layer is the most expressive linear layer under the given equivariance constraints, and subsumes recently introduced equivariant models for sets, exchangeable tensors, and graphs. The proposed feed-forward layer has linear complexity in the the data and can be used for both inductive and transductive reasoning about relational databases, including database embedding, and the prediction of missing records. This, provides a principled theoretical foundation for the application of deep learning to one of the most abundant forms of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             5\n",
            "Abstract:###To simultaneously capture syntax and semantics from a text corpus, we propose a new larger-context language model that extracts recurrent hierarchical semantic structure via a dynamic deep topic model to guide natural language generation. Moving beyond a conventional language model that ignores long-range word dependencies and sentence order, the proposed model captures not only intra-sentence word dependencies, but also temporal transitions between sentences and inter-sentence topic dependences. For inference, we develop a hybrid of stochastic-gradient MCMC and recurrent autoencoding variational Bayes. Experimental results on a variety of real-world text corpora demonstrate that the proposed model not only outperforms state-of-the-art larger-context language models, but also learns interpretable recurrent multilayer topics and generates diverse sentences and paragraphs that are syntactically correct and semantically coherent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             5\n",
            "Abstract:###The use of deep learning for a wide range of data problems has increased the need for understanding and diagnosing these models, and deep learning interpretation techniques have become an essential tool for data analysts. Although numerous model interpretation methods have been proposed in recent years, most of these procedures are based on heuristics with little or no theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for saliency estimation for black box computer vision models. We build a model-agnostic estimation procedure that is statistically consistent and passes the saliency checks of Adebayo et al. (2018). Our method requires solving a linear program, whose solution can be efficiently computed in polynomial time. Through our theoretical analysis, we establish an upper bound on the number of model evaluations needed to recover the region of importance with high probability, and build a new perturbation scheme for estimation of local gradients that is shown to be more efficient than the commonly used random perturbation schemes. Validity of the new method is demonstrated through sensitivity analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                5\n",
            "Abstract:###Due to the significant costs of data generation, many prediction tasks within drug discovery are by nature few-shot regression (FSR) problems, including accurate modelling of biological assays. Although a number of few-shot classification and reinforcement learning methods exist for similar applications, we find relatively few FSR methods meeting the performance standards required for such tasks under real-world constraints. Inspired by deep kernel learning, we develop a novel FSR algorithm that is better suited to these settings. Our algorithm consists of learning a deep network in combination with a kernel function and a differentiable kernel algorithm. As the choice of the kernel is critical, our algorithm learns to find the appropriate one for each task during inference. It thus performs more effectively with complex task distributions, outperforming current state-of-the-art algorithms on both toy and novel, real-world benchmarks that we introduce herein. By introducing novel benchmarks derived from biological assays, we hope that the community will progress towards the development of FSR algorithms suitable for use in noisy and uncertain environments such as drug discovery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            5\n",

            "Abstract:###Learning control policies in robotic tasks requires a large number of interactions due to small learning rates, bounds on the updates or unknown constraints. In contrast humans can infer protective and safe solutions after a single failure or unexpected observation. In order to reach similar performance, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm that replicates the cognitive inference and memorization process for avoiding failures in motor control tasks. A Gaussian Process implements the modeling and the sampling of the acquisition function. This enables rapid learning with large learning rates while a mental replay phase ensures that policy regions that led to failures are inhibited during the sampling process. The features of the hierarchical Bayesian optimization method are evaluated in a simulated and physiological humanoid postural balancing task. We quantitatively compare the human learning performance to our learning approach by evaluating the deviations of the center of mass during training. Our results show that we can reproduce the efficient learning of human subjects in postural control tasks which provides a testable model for future physiological motor control tasks. In these postural control tasks, our method outperforms standard Bayesian Optimization in the number of interactions to solve the task, in the computational demands and in the frequency of observed failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",
            "Abstract:###This paper presents a generic framework to tackle the crucial class mismatch problem in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for multi-class distributions. Previous adversarial learning methods condition domain alignment only on pseudo labels, but noisy and inaccurate pseudo labels may perturb the multi-class distribution embedded in probabilistic predictions, hence bringing insufficient alleviation to the latent mismatch problem. Compared with pseudo labels, class prototypes are more accurate and reliable since they summarize over all the instances and are able to represent the inherent semantic distribution shared across domains. Therefore, we propose a novel Prototype-Assisted Adversarial Learning (PAAL) scheme, which incorporates instance probabilistic predictions and class prototypes together to provide reliable indicators for adversarial domain alignment. With the PAAL scheme, we align both the instance feature representations and class prototype representations to alleviate the mismatch among semantically different classes. Also, we exploit the class prototypes as proxy to minimize the within-class variance in the target domain to mitigate the mismatch among semantically similar classes. With these novelties, we constitute a Prototype-Assisted Conditional Domain Adaptation (PACDA) framework which well tackles the class mismatch problem. We demonstrate the good performance and generalization ability of the PAAL scheme and also PACDA framework on two UDA tasks, i.e., object recognition (Office-Home,ImageCLEF-DA, andOffice) and synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation (GTA5?CityscapesandSynthia?Cityscapes).    2\n",
            "Abstract:###Graph convolution networks (GCN) have emerged as a leading method to classify nodes and graphs. These GCN have been combined with active learning (AL) methods, when a small chosen set of tagged examples can be used. Most AL-GCN use the sample class uncertainty as selection criteria, and not the graph. In contrast, representative sampling uses the graph, but not the prediction. We propose to combine the two and query nodes based on the uncertainty of the graph around them. We here propose two novel methods to select optimal nodes in AL-GCN that explicitly use the graph information to query for optimal nodes. The first method named regional uncertainty is an extension of the classical entropy measure, but instead of sampling nodes with high entropy, we propose to sample nodes surrounded by nodes of different classes, or nodes with high ambiguity. The second method called Adaptive Page-Rank is an extension of the page-rank algorithm, where nodes that have a low probability of being reached by random walks from tagged nodes are selected. We show that the latter is optimal when the fraction of tagged nodes is low, and when this fraction grows to one over the average degree, the regional uncertainty performs better than all existing methods. While we have tested these methods on graphs, such methods can be extended to any classification problem, where a distance can be defined between the input samples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2\n",
            "Abstract:###Understanding black-box machine learning models is important towards their widespread adoption. However, developing globally interpretable models that explain the behavior of the entire model is challenging. An alternative approach is to explain black-box models through explaining individual prediction using a locally interpretable model. In this paper, we propose a novel method for locally interpretable modeling -- Reinforcement Learning-based Locally Interpretable Modeling (RL-LIM). RL-LIM employs reinforcement learning to select a small number of samples and distill the black-box model prediction into a low-capacity locally interpretable model. Training is guided with a reward that is obtained directly by measuring agreement of the predictions from the locally interpretable model with the black-box model. RL-LIM near-matches the overall prediction performance of black-box models while yielding human-like interpretability, and significantly outperforms state of the art locally interpretable models in terms of overall prediction performance and fidelity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2\n",
            "Abstract:###We propose a new framework for reasoning about information in complex systems. Our foundation is based on a variational extension of Shannon’s information theory that takes into account the modeling power and computational constraints of the observer. The resulting predictive F-information encompasses mutual information and other notions of informativeness such as the coefficient of determination. Unlike Shannon’s mutual information and in violation of the data processing inequality, F-information can be created through computation. This is consistent with deep neural networks extracting hierarchies of progressively more informative features in representation learning. Additionally, we show that by incorporating computational constraints, F-information can be reliably estimated from data even in high dimensions with PAC-style guarantees. Empirically, we demonstrate predictive F-information is more effective than mutual information for structure learning and fair representation learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2\n",

            "Comment:###The paper proposes a new learning algorithm for deep neural networks that first reformulates the problem as a multi-convex and then uses an alternating update to solve. The reviewers are concerned about the closeness to previous work, comparisons with related work like dlADMM, and the difficulty of the dataset. While the authors proposed the possibility of addressing some of these issues, the reviewers feel that without actually addressing them, the paper is not yet ready for publication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2\n",
            "Comment:###The paper focuses on adversarial domain adaptation, and proposes an approach inspired from the DANN. The contribution lies in additional terms in the loss, aimed to i) align the source and target prototypes in each class (using pseudo labels for target examples); ii) minimize the variance of the latent representations for each class in the target domain. Reviews point out that the expected benefits of target prototypes might be ruined if the pseudo-labels are too noisy; they note that the specific problem needs be more clearly formalized and they regret the lack of clarity of the text. The sensitivity w.r.t. the hyper-parameter values needs be assessed more thoroughly. One also notes that SAFN is one of the baseline methods; but its best variant (with entropic regularization) is not considered, while the performance thereof is on par or greater than that of PACFA for ImageCLEF-Da; idem for AdapSeg (consider its multi-level variant) or AdvEnt with MinEnt. For these reasons, the paper seems premature for publication at ICLR 2020.                                                                                                                      2\n",

Both reviewers raised issues with the clarity of presentation, as well as contribution and overall fit to this venue. The authors’ response helped to clarify these issues only marginally. Therefore, primarily due to lack of clarity, I recommend rejecting this paper, but encourage the authors to improve the presentation as per the reviewers’ suggestions and resubmitting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     2\n",
            "Comment:###The paper proposes a method for performing active learning on graph convolutional networks. In particular, instead of performing uncertainty-based sampling based on an individual node level, the authors propose to look at regional based uncertainty. They propose an efficient algorithm based on page rank. Empirically, they compare their method to several other leading methods, comparing favorably. Reviewers found the work poorly organized and difficult to read. The idea to use region based estimates is intuitive but feels like nothing more than just that. It*s not clear if there is a mathematical basis to justify such a method (e.g. an analysis of sample complexity as has been accomplished in other graph active learning problems, Dasarathy, Nowak, Zhu 2015). The idea requires further study and justification, and the paper needs an improved exposition. Finally, the authors were not anonymized on the PDF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",
            "Comment:###The paper aims to find locally interpretable models, such that the local models are fit (w.r.t. the ground truth) and faithful (w.r.t. the global underlying black box model). The contribution of the paper is that the local model is trained from a subset of points, selected via an optimized importance weight function. The difference compared to Ren et al. (cited) is that the IW function is non-differentiable and optimized using Reinforcement Learning. A first concern (Rev#1, Rev#2) regards the positioning of the paper w.r.t. RL, as the actual optimization method could be any black-box optimization method: one wants to find the IW that maximizes the faithfulness. The rebuttal makes a good job in explaining the impact of using a non-differentiable IW function. A second concern (Rev#2) regards the interpretability of the IW underlying the local interpretable model. There is no doubt that the paper was considerably improved during the rebuttal period. However, the improvements raise additional questions (e.g. about selecting the IW depending on the distance to the probes). I encourage the authors to continue on this promising line of search.       2\n",

            "Review:###The paper presents an improvement to the task of transfer learning by being deliberate about which channels from the base model are most relevant to the new task at hand. It does this by apply attentive feature selection (AFS) to select channels or features that align well with the down stream task and attentive feature distillation (AFD) to pass on these features to the student network. In the process they do channel pruning there by decreasing the size of the network and enabling faster inference speeds. Their major argument is that plain transfer learning is redundant and wasteful and careful attention applied to selection of the features and channels to be transfered can lead to smaller faster models which in several cases presented in the paper provide superior performance. Paper is clear and concise and experimentally sound showing a real contribution to the body of knowledge in transfer learning and pruning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",
            "Review:###This paper proposes a new oversampling method for class-imbalanced datasets, which is called Adversarial Minority Over-sampling (AMO). Its contribution is that it performs over-sampling using the samples of the majority classes, not the minority classes. It generates adversarial examples of the majority class and labels them as one of the minority classes. The purpose of using the majority class samples is that it can solve the problem of overfitting minority classes by using samples from minority classes too much, which is a typical problem of ordinary over-sampling techniques. For this purpose, the authors propose a new optimization objective that generates synthetic samples by transforming the majority class samples and devises a rejection criterion to determine whether the generated sample is appropriate, motivated by the concept of effective number of samples. They also proposed the distribution of the appropriate initial seed point of the generation through newly designed criteria. I do not think this paper is acceptable in the current state, and there exist some ambiguous issues where clarification and more supporting evidences are required. However, as a new novel approach to mitigate the over-fitting issue, if the following questions are answered reasonably, this paper may become acceptable. 1. As the authors mentioned consistently, the classifier g that generates adversarial examples is unreliable and potentially over-fitted to minority classes, which means that the classifier g cannot learn the general features for the minority classes. It is clear that the classifier g would make reasonable adversarial examples for the majority classes, but it is unclear that the generated examples by g are reasonable to be labeled as one of the minority classes, a target class. Although the classifier g would classify the generated example as the target class, it does not mean that it captured the general features of the target class and generated the adversarial sample using them. Instead, I think it is possible that the resulting synthetic example can be labeled as any minor class, not just as the target minor class. In the reported results, the proposed method would learn how to distinguish each major class from the last and fail to generalize in minority classes and make any example with the only constraint that it does not have the feature of starting (major) class, regardless what the target class is. Thus, I ask the authors to a) provide the evidence that the model g generates the samples with general features for each minor class and b) explain clearly how it is possible. c) I also suggest the authors to show the recall in addition to the accuracy in Tables 1 and 2. 2. I am wondering why f does not have to classify synthetic examples as their target classes, as stated right below Equation (2) in page 3. It seems reasonable for f to classify the example exactly like g. Even in Figure 4, it seems that the classifier g attempted to generate ‘Truck’ class example, but it failed, as the model f classified it as ‘Bird.’ It would be great if the authors clarify how the classifier work in this manner and what is the expected outcome of f. 3. Also, I am wondering why the accuracy of major class examples decrease from 2% to 7% consistently if AMO is applied to ERM or LDAM in CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset. I conjecture it is because the features of the starting example are not fully ‘erased.’ Also, I think that the proposed method affects the performance of the majority class in page 2. In this respect, I would like to see how many samples of major classes are correctly classified previously but misclassified after the model was trained with synthetic adversarial examples, to check the effect of adversarial examples on learning the major class. 4. It is a minor point, but it needs clarification on how the train/test set was constructed in both g and f, e.g., whether they have the exactly same training set.    1\n",
            " This manuscript proposes an over-sampling method for dealing with the imbalanced classification and long-trailed problems. The authors refer to their work as Advserarial Minority Over-sampling (AMO). The interesting aspect of this paper is that it explores adversarial perturbation (possibly of majority class) as a means of over-sampling for the minority class. The findings suggest that it could improve imbalanced learning. However, there are several major issues with the paper in its current form: - There is a recent publication with almost the same topic in ICCV 2019 that also explores using adversarial minority over sampling frameworks (published on arxiv on Apr 3, 2019 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09730.pdf). Although that one is a bit different methodologically, the authors have not mentioned it, compare with it, nor discussed it. It is not clear where the current manuscript stands in comparison with the ICCV 2019 paper. - Given the above paper, the novelties of the proposed technique become marginal. - Another major issue with the paper is its methodological limitations. As the authors have also mentioned, it looks a bit like learning to classify the adversarial examples. It seems like this is a very effective method if we want to classify a majority (normal) class versus a minority (anomaly) class. Because when the model generates adversarial examples for any specific class the adversarial examples may cover all space of the samples minus the samples of that (normal) class. Therefore, the model does not learn the geometry of the minority class (as opposed to many state-of-the-art long-trailed classification models) and only learns the majority class. This is not itself a positive characteristic. - The authors have not provided any theoretical discussions/guarantees why adversarial examples should be a good means of learning the imbalanced distributions. Everything in the paper seems to be experimental and heuristic. - The accuracy metric provided by the authors is a bit misleading. For these cases of long-trailed classification models, Average Class Specific Accuracy and Geometric Mean (analogous to F1-score) are the most relevant ones to report, especially because experiments are conducted on multi-class settings. - The results in Table 2 show a highly imbalanced classification rate between majority and minority classes. This means that neither the proposed method nor the baselines could solve the problem. The differences between the proposed method and the baselines do not seem to be statistically significant. So, what is the purpose of this experiment!?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
            "Review:###This paper proposes two approaches to quantify neuron importance in CNNs. The first method based on Shapley value computes the marginal contribution of each filter; and the second approach uses probabilistic variational inference. The algorithmic contribution is demonstrated with a suite of experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, using LeNet and VGG architectures. This paper should be rejected primarily because (1) the algorithms are not well justified either by theory or practice; (2) the two approaches described are loosely connected and therefore making the paper lack of focus; and (3) the experiments lack comparison with many other existing state-of-the-art neural compression methods. Specifically, this paper lacks theoretical and/or empirical justification on why individual neuron’s contribution during the learning process can be characterized equivalently as a coalitional game. How is the characteristic function chosen in practice? Does this depend on the neural network architecture in use? Further experiments should be provided to show ablation on this. The authors should also consider reporting the measurement in time for computing the Shapley value, in order to justify the computation feasibility. How well does the approximated solution compared to the optimal solution? What’s the time and performance tradeoff? In the experimental section, the author should consider providing details on how to choose the number of channels (for different layers) to prune based on the ranking. How does the pruning strategy affect the model performance? This paper can be strengthened by comparing with existing state-of-the-art compression methods such as knowledge distillation (Hinton et al), SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet and other quantization based methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
            "Review:###The authors define two new methods for ranking the influence of individual units on the output of convolutional networks. They show that some overlap exists between the units chosen by these two methods, they use these methods to select filters to visualize, and they use one of the methods to prune/compress trained convolutional networks. Their compression method outperforms prior work. Pros The neuron ranking method produces compressed models that compare favorably with prior work (Table 2). Cons I found the clarity of this paper overall to be somewhat poor. These points especially need to be addressed The acronyms for the baselines in table 2 are not defined or cited. Lack of clarity about the pruning experiment: Why is the Shapley value method not included here? I*m assuming NR stands for neuron ranking. Lack of clarity about visualizations: Are the rankings used to choose filters to visualize from Shapley values or neuron ranking? The units [1,8,3,7] don*t seem to be seem to all be selected by either method for MNIST conv1 in Table 1. I wasn*t convinced by the feature map visualization section, because as far as I can tell the unimportant nodes don*t look very different from the important nodes. Specifically, in both the important and unimportant node feature maps, a class example is clearly visible. Perhaps the authors could clarify what the critical difference is between these feature maps. The neuron ranking method seems to give only a marginal advantage over simple magnitude pruning. Overall The compression results seem strong in comparison to past work, but marginal in comparison to the simple baselines. The feature map visualizations were not compelling, and may require clarification. Comments *the deeper architecture also become wider* -- I*m not sure what this means. *the units in the network (both convolutional filters and nodes in fully connected layers) are not equally important when it comes to performing an inference task.* -- Morcos et al., 2018 seems relevant https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1iuQjxCZ. *We visualize the most significant features which significantly show the significance of repeated and complementary features* -- I didn*t quite understand this.

            "Review:###This paper proposed a contextual temperature scaling to improve language modeling. The temperature model is parameterized using a deep neural network. Experiments on the language modeling datasets show some effects of the method. The idea of dynamic temperature scaling has been tried in other works and tasks (e.g., attended temperature scaling). The paper parameterizes this mechanism with DNNs for the language model. Though the idea looks interesting, it fails to explain why the scaling is better than other dynamic temperature scaling frameworks. The experiments are not solid. The baseline only includes Mos, which is not very strong. To validate whether this approach works with other LM of high-order attention or self-attention, a better baseline model is required (e.g., transformer, GPT). I would like to see this technique can help either NLU or NLG tasks, instead of just pure modeling. The case analysis section needs more examples instead of just cherry-picking few.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
            "Review:###This paper presents a strategy to automatically adjust the temperature scaling based on the context of words in a sentence for NLP. Experiments demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve perplexity scores on several datasets popular for NLP. NLP is not an area of research I*m very familiar with so this review is limited to my understanding of temperature scaling as a general technique to improve learning. As described in the paper, temperature scaling is a type of hyper-parameter estimation that adjusts the sensitivity of the softmax function as training evolves. The paper proposes to learn a function that given context, adjust the temperature automatically. This can be seen as a meta-learning method. I believe this can be a useful technique but before considering such an approach as a general strategy, more theoretical insights should be provided. The authors report on ablation studies that demonstrate some empirical benefits. However, until I see more theoretical analysis on how the method improves convergence or lead to better losses by smoothing out the output of the objective function, I remain skeptical of the usefulness of this as a general training method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
            "Review:###The paper proposes a new loss function which adds to the training objective another term that pulls the current parameters of a neural network further away from the parameters at a previous time step. Intuitively, this aims to push the current parameters further to the local optimum. On a variety of benchmarks, optimizing the proposed loss function achieves better results than just optimizing the training loss. The paper is well written and easy to follow. However, I am not entirely convinced about the intuition of the proposed method and I think further investigation are necessary. While the method is simple and general, it also seems to be rather heuristic and requires carefully chosen hyperparameters. Having said that, the empirical evidence shows that the proposed loss function consistently improves performance. The following details should be addressed further: - I am a bit confused by the definition of the loss function. In Equation 1 it seems that the term on the left represents the training objective. If that is correct than Equation 2 second case contains the training objective twice? - F in Section 3 after Equation 2 is not properly defined - Could it happen that the proposed loss function leads to divergence, for example if the parameter from a previous time step theta^Tp is close to the optimum theta_star? - What is the motivation to use the L1 norm? How does this choice affect convergence compared to let*s L2 norm? - Section 4.1 typo in first paragraph: K instead of kappa - Section 4.1 the results would be more convincing if all networks were trained multiple times with a different random initialization and Table 1 would include the mean and std. - Why is no warm-up period used for the GAN experiments? - Section 4.3: why is kappa increase by 1% for the speech recognition experiments where as by 2% for all other experiments? - I suggest to increase the line width of all figures since they are somewhat hard to identify on a print version. - Why is the momentum set to 0.5 for SGD in the ablation study? Most frameworks use a default value of 0.9. - I would like to see the affect of the warm-up period to the performance in the ablation study. - How does the choice of learning rate schedule, such as for example cosine annealing, affect the loss function? post rebuttal ------------------ I thank the authors for clarifying my questions and providing additional experiments. I think that especially the additional ablation studies and reporting the mean and std of multiple trials make the contribution of the paper more convincing. Hence, I increased my score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
            "Review:###This paper presents the retrospective loss to optimize neural network training. The idea behind the retrospective loss is to add a penalization term between the current model to the model from a few iterations before. Extensive experimental results on a wide range of datasets are provided to show the effectiveness of the retrospective loss. The retrospective loss is additionally controlled by two hyperparameters, the strength parameter K and the update frequency T_p. This loss, measured in L-1 norm, is added to the training objective. The geometric intuition of the added loss term is that this pushes the model away from the model at iteration T_p. The paper argues that this shrinks the parameter space of the loss function. One of the concern regards the writing of the paper. - Algorithm 1 and Figure 6 look very blurry, which I think are both below the publication standard. - The introduction could be written to be more helpful, such as providing more context on why the obtained experimental results are important (e.g. getting state-of-the-art results on the datasets studied in the experiments) - The Related Work contrasts with previous work which is not clear because the precise contribution has not been stated at the point. More detailed questions: - What are the standard deviations for the experimental results (as you reported in Table 4 but not in other experiments)? - I*m curious whether the use of L-1 norm is critical or not in the retrospective loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
            "Review:###This paper start merely by studying the graph reconstruction problem and prove that the intrinsic structure of this task itself automatically produces the complete definition of groups. it seems to be a novel result. Based on this result, one could construct embedding models that naturally accommodate all possible local graph patterns, and the paper also shows a few simulations. My main concern is that, while the focus on this work is the theoretical finding, there is no rigorous statement of it as a theorem. As a result, I am not exactly sure what the proofs in the appendix is trying to show. In addition, the proofs seems to be very trivial. For the algorithm section, I feel that it is also lacking in the sense that there is still no automatic way to choose which group to embed. It is also unclear what is the purpose of the simulation section. While it says *As theoretically analyzed in Section 3.2, and empirically shown above, continuous nonabelian groups are more reasonable choices for general tasks*, the advantage of continuous nonabelian groups are not so significant in the tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

This could be the case for frequently occurring keywords, though it may also simply be a coincidence. On the other hand, popular keywords with low acceptance rates might point to highly competitive or saturated areas.\n",

By focusing on papers with keywords that have a higher acceptance rate, we can potentially increase the likelihood of selecting papers with a higher probability of acceptance, while excluding those with keywords that are less likely to be accepted.\n",

        "We have compared two methods to assess the importance of keywords and their relationship with paper acceptance rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Statistical Approach:\n",
        "The first approach relies on a statistical method, which simply counts the occurrences of each keyword in the dataset and tracks how many times each keyword is associated with accepted papers. This method provides a quick way to assess the likelihood of a paper's acceptance based on the presence of certain keywords. However, the frequency of a keyword is a crucial factor here, as more frequent keywords are likely to appear in successful papers, giving this method an inherent bias toward high-frequency terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Machine Learning Approach:\n",
        "The second method leverages machine learning to assess the importance of each keyword in predicting the acceptance or rejection of papers. Here, too, the frequency of a keyword plays an important role in determining its importance in the model. Keywords with higher frequency are more likely to have more accurate predictions because they are present in more papers, while rarer keywords may have less statistical power due to limited data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion:\n",
        "By combining both the statistical insights (frequency and acceptance rate) and the machine learning model's keyword importance, we can derive a more nuanced understanding of which keywords are likely to indicate successful papers. Frequently occurring, high-importance keywords in the model often correlate with higher acceptance rates. However, even keywords that appear less frequently but are deemed highly important by the model may still significantly contribute to a paper's likelihood of success."

        "\n",
        "## Handling Multiple Keywords\n",
        "- Some papers may have multiple keywords, one with a high acceptance rate and another with a lower acceptance rate. We need to define a formula for the paper score considering both cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Assuming each keyword's acceptance is independent, we can compute the average acceptance rate for all keywords associated with a paper. If the average acceptance rate exceeds a given threshold (e.g., 80%), this would suggest a higher likelihood of acceptance for that paper. This allows us to handle cases where papers have mixed keywords in terms of acceptance rates.\n",

        "- Frequent phrases, these could indicate common strengths or weaknesses across accepted papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sentiment and tone, positive or negative tones in the reviews may help correlate specific attributes with higher acceptance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Review scores, are there particular sections that consistently receive higher or lower scores? These might point to areas that are particularly important for success.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Additional Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "- Acceptance is not solely determined by keywords, it's important to keep in mind that other factors, beyond just the keywords, may play a significant role in the acceptance of a paper. For example, the paper's overall structure, the clarity of writing, novelty, technical depth, and contributions to the field could also be crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Keyword importance is just one piece of the puzzle, while a high acceptance rate for certain keywords can guide us, it's essential to balance this with other aspects of the paper that contribute to its success. By analyzing the reviews and the overall paper content, we can gain a deeper understanding of what drives success in accepted papers.\n",

        "Third, even small contributions like introducing a new mechanism (in this case, “policy modulation”) were appreciated.

        "\n",
        "Another key point is generalization. Reviewers noted that the model generalized to more complex tasks than those seen during training.

Generalization is often considered a strong indicator of a model’s robustness and applicability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Beyond specific topic\n",
        "Beyond specific content, the reviews show that reviewers value both technical performance and the broader research direction. Even if your results are modest, positioning your work as contributing to a long-term research question can make it more compelling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, your paper structure matters. Reviewers often form their impressions based on the abstract, introduction, and visual elements. Make sure these parts are clear, concise, and informative, as they are likely to be the first things readers will engage with.\n",

        "# Conclusion\n",
        "To understand what contributes to a paper being accepted — and therefore how to write better papers — I based my methodology on analyzing features of already accepted papers. The intuition is simple: if we want to write better papers, we should learn from the ones that succeeded.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, I combined two complementary sources of information:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Keyword-based acceptance rate, this provides a simple and fast value by analyzing how often certain keywords appear in accepted papers. It reflects the historical success of topics and terminology in the field. By identifying high-acceptance-rate keywords, we can understand the topics that are more likely to align with the expectations of the reviewing community.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Machine learning model prediction, a Random Forest classifier was trained on labeled data (accepted vs. rejected) using keyword features. This adds a data-driven perspective, capturing patterns and interactions not immediately obvious through traditional statistics alone. The model allows us to quantify the importance of each keyword, providing insights into which topics or terms have a stronger correlation with acceptance or rejection.\n",
        "\n",
        "By averaging these two components, I created a more balanced and explainable score, the final acceptance likelihood. This score allows us to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Identify keywords and topics that are statistically linked with acceptance, highlighting trends in successful research.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Estimate a paper's chances of being accepted based on its content, providing authors with a metric that quantifies their paper's alignment with successful patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Provide actionable feedback to authors, guiding them on how to align their paper with historically accepted research.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, understanding what not to do is equally important. Therefore, this same approach can be extended to rejected papers, helping highlight topics, structures, or keyword combinations that are statistically less successful. These insights provide negative signals, things to avoid or improve, which are just as valuable as positive patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, by analyzing the key aspects of accepted papers (as extracted from their reviews), we can distill common themes and feedback that led to their success. By training a machine learning model on this data, we could even create a generalizable guide on how to write successful papers based on the specific elements that reviewers appreciated across a broad spectrum of accepted works.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, this project served as a way to explore how meaningful knowledge can be extracted from data and how such insights can be leveraged for further analytical methods. While not a complete or exhaustive study, it already touches on several interesting themes, from keyword-based analysis to sentiment interpretation and demonstrates how even limited data, when well-analyzed, can offer valuable understanding.\\\n",
        "Given the time constraints and the limited knowledge on the use of modern machine learning models, the work provides a nice foundation and allows for further investigations."

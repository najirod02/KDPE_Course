# Reichenbach assignment
Below the solutions to the questions

## 1 - Theory

### a
If we have 10 distinct memebers then we have 10! permutations.

### b
We can consider them as a single unit (a single person) so 10-1=9 person.
Moreover one of them can be seated on the left or on the right
so we have to multiply by 2.
We obtain 9!*2 permutations

### c
It's like having 2 groups A,B both of them have 5! combinations but I have to multiply them together 5!*5! and also by 2 as we can alternate the seating on two ways obtainign 5!*5!*2


## 2 - Python

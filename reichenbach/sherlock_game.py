'''
Holmes and Moriarty duel with a device spitting integers from 1 to 100. 
Holmes adds to S (from 0) until S > 100, noting his last number x. 
Moriarty resumes, adding until S > 200, noting y. 
The higher wins. 
Simulate 100,000 rounds in Python 3 and estimate Moriartyâ€™s victory odds, 
as if outsmarting Holmes at Reichenbach.

import random

'''
the function simulates a single game round.
it will be called 'num_simulations' times

Returns true only if holmes wins that is, the value of x is strictly larger
than the values of y, the last number extracted from moriarty
